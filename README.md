# pomodoro-clock

### ToDo
- Add app states, probably (stopped, paused, work, break) and update logic based on these states. After work period is done break should start. When the clock is in progress or paused counters shouldn't update it.
- Implement indicator logic
- Separate timer view into 5 parts 12:00 => | 1 | 2 | : | 0 | 0 | to prevent dragging when the timer is updated. 
- Make the app responsive
