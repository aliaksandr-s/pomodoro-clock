### ToDo
- Separate timer view into 5 parts 12:00 => | 1 | 2 | : | 0 | 0 | to prevent dragging when the timer is updated. 
- Add sounds on change between work and break
- Add periods counter 
- Period updates should be only possible in the beggining or just after reset(not during work or pause). 
- Make the app responsive
